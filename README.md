#### FORK OF https://github.com/vicenterusso/Script-Execution-Order-Manager

I just added a scroll view for the list of scripts, because my screen wasn't big enough to display them all. 

Install via Package Manager -> Add from git -> https://github.com/fffogil/Script-Execution-Order-Manager.git

# Unity3D: Script Execution Order Manager

The Builtin Script Execution Order (Edit > Project Settings > Script Execution Order) can be boring and tedious to find and add a script when you have a lot of scripts. This is a small utility to help. It supports:

 * Drag to reorder;
 * Default time can be moved;
 * Search/Autocomplete
 * Display Namespaces

#### USAGE

Tools > Script Execution Order Manager
