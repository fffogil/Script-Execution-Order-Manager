# Unity3D: Script Execution Order Manager

The Builtin Script Execution Order (Edit > Project Settings > Script Execution Order) can be boring and tedious to find and add a script when you have a lot of scripts. This is a small utility to help. It supports:

 * Drag to reorder;
 * Default time can be moved;
 * Search/Autocomplete
 * Display Namespaces
 
#### INSTALL FROM PACKAGE MANAGER (RECOMMENDED)

Add to your `manifest.json` the following line:

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.vrusso.scriptexecreordermanager": "https://github.com/vicenterusso/Script-Execution-Order-Manager.git",
  },
}
```
