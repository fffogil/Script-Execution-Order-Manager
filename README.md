# Unity3D: Script Execution Order Manager

The Builtin Script Execution Order (Edit > Project Settings > Script Execution Order) can be boring and tedious to find and add a script when you have a lot of scripts. This is a small utility to help. It supports:

 * Drag to reorder;
 * Default time can be moved;
 * Search/Autocomplete
